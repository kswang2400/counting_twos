# counting twos

## Problem: 
Count the 2’s between 0 and N.  And every 2 digit counts as a 2, so if N was 7 
the answer would be 1 (just the number 2), whereas if n was 23 there would be 7 2’s 
{2, 12, 20, 21, 22 (this counts for 2), 23}

## Solution:

I noticed there was a pattern based on how many digits were in the number 

```
range (order of magnitude)      number of zeros
(0..9)   one digit total:       **1**
(10..19)                        1       
(20..29)                        11
(30..39)                        1       1 * 10 + 10 = 20
...
(90.99)                         1
(10..99) (two digit total)      **20**
(100.199)                       20
(200.299)                       120     20 * 10 + 100 = 300
(100.999) (three digit total)   **300**
(1000.9999) (four digit total)  **4000**
```

ever "pile" in an order of magnitude (e.g. 10..19, 20..29, 30..39) will be the same
size as the total of the previous order of magnitude. If it's prepended by a two,
then you need to add 10 * (d - 1) where d is the number of digits for all the leading 
2's in that piles.

Additionally, the sum of each order of magnitude can be furthered simplified down to 

```(n) * (10 ** (n - 1))``` 

where n is the order of magnitude of that number. 

Because of these two patterns, there is a mathematical way to solve any number 
in practically constant time by breaking the number into piles of different magnitudes
and computing the total for each

```
Example:  5876
          (0..4999) + (5000..5876)
                      (0..876)  *disregard leading 5, never will be 2
                      (0..799) + (800..876)
                                 (0..76)
                                 (0..69) + (70..76)
                                           (0..6)
```

Edge Cases: When the digit is a two, you can't disregard the leading 2, so whatever 
number remains is what you have to add to the final total (referred to as extra in the code)

```
Example: 1234
         (0..999) + (1000..1234)
                    (0..234)
                    (0..199) + (200..234) *need to consider 34 + 1 more 2's
                               (0..34)     in the hundreds place
                               (0..29) + (30..34)
                                         (0..4)
```

### Environment

run ```bundle install``` if you plan on running test suite

run ```rspec spec``` to run test suite

run ```ruby script.rb``` to view benchmarks (listed below)

otherwise, to run custom test cases, cd into ```lib```, open ```pry```, and ```load "counting_twos.rb"```

### Usage

```
  load "counting_twos.rb"
  => true
  c = TwoCounter.new
  => #<TwoCounter:0x007fc64d6d7958 @cache={}>
  c.counting_twos(15432)
  => 6694
  c.counting_twos(321)
  =>  164
  c.counting_twos(123)
  =>  27
  c
  => #<TwoCounter:0x007fc64d6d7958 @cache={15432=>6693, 321=>164, 123=>27}>
```

much more scalable than naive solution; implemented memcache for quick lookup of old numbers

```
Benchmark.bm do |benchmark|
  benchmark.report { p counter.counting_twos_naive(1928374) }
  benchmark.report { p counter.counting_twos(      1928374, false) }
  benchmark.report { p counter.counting_twos(321) }
  benchmark.report { p counter.counting_twos(123) }
  benchmark.report { p counter.counting_twos_naive(1928374) }
end
